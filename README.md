# Project React Native App ðŸ“±

The goal was to create an APP via Expo for the first time and to use one of an device sensors.
I used the shake sensor to display random images from an API.

## The problem

I had some trouble with getting the expo tools up and running - gave me some limit of time for solving this project.
For example I did not get IOS simulator to run. I realized that Xcode needed to be installed, and therefor I had to make an IOS version upgrade on my Mac. This was solved after some struggles with loosing settings in vs code after the upgrade.
To get information of all tools and settings I used StackOverflow, my wonderful Lions team and https://reactnative.dev/

Regarding the coding I first tried to use the sensors branch - then I got some trouble to view it in my device. Therfor I started to work in the main branch to avoid the sensor. But after all my struggles with the tools I decided to go back to the sensors branch and try to get it work - and it did finally!

If I hade more time - I would have liked to do more styling of the project and also implemented a button.
